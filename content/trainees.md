**Current status:** _Not_ seeking any trainees.

I am current focused on building out the [compcogneuro.org](https://compcogneuro.org) website with complete documentation and simulations of my integrated model of brain function at the level of a rodent (miniaturized). Once the first pass on this is complete, in roughly a year or so, then I will be in a position to consider re-engaging with trainees and collaborations. However, at this point, extreme focus is required!
